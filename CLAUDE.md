# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project called "GPTComparison" focused on trading applications. The project is in its early stages with minimal implementation.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Currently contains a basic Python template with a sample function
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration using modern Python packaging standards
- `README.md` - Basic project documentation (currently just project title)

## Development Environment

- **Python Version**: Requires Python >=3.13
- **Package Management**: Uses pyproject.toml for dependency management
- **Project Name**: gptcomparison (version 0.1.0)

## Common Commands

Since this project uses pyproject.toml, standard Python development commands apply:

```bash
# Install the project in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the main script
python main.py
```

## Current State

The project appears to be a fresh template with placeholder code. The main.py file contains PyCharm's default template code and will likely need to be replaced with actual trading/GPT comparison functionality.

## Architecture Notes

- No external dependencies are currently defined
- No test framework is currently set up
- The project structure suggests this will be a comparison tool for GPT models in a trading context, but implementation details are not yet present
